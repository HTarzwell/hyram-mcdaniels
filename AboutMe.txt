Introduction
I am an author, ESL teacher, editor, and designer with a passion for good visuals, accessibility, and intuitive design.  I am educated in political science and teaching English as a second language, and my focus is on globally sustainable and accessible design and outreach.  I love the internet and the world of possibilities it represents, and the chance to help build this new frontier of human civilization is one I can't pass up.
What's Important To Me
My education and life experiences have left me with a passion for equality, representation, intersectionality, accessibility, and environmentally sustainable consciousness and design.  
Where I'm From
Canada, Eh? 
Favourite Hobbies
I'm an avid reader and writer, enthusiastic amateur knitter, and if the stars are right I sometimes make my own clothes.  I walk everywhere I can, do low-intensity yoga, and run when the weather is right.  I also love comics and cartoons, and playing low-stress video games.
Dream Job
There's no single hard dream job that I want, but my ultimate dream would be to combine all my passions into a new job, like combining six cool robots into one even cooler giant robot.
Recently Favoured Jams
I've become addicted to Two Steps From Hell, fantastic stuff for when you're plotting a novel about divinely ordained pirates.

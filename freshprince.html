        <h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
        <p>
        	<dl>
        	<dt>From western Philadelphia I hail</dt>
            <dt>where in my youth I'd play upon the green</dt>
            <dt>'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd</dt>
            <dt>by ruffians contemptible and mean.</dt>
            <dt>Although the spat was trivial and brief,</dt> 
            <dt>it wounded my dear mother deep within;</dt> 
            <dt>and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,</dt>  
            <dt>she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.</dt> 
            <dt>When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,</dt> 
            <dt>I came upon a coachman most unique;</dt> 
            <dt>and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,</dt> 
            <dt>despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.</dt>
            <dt>I survey all the land with princely mien</dt> 
            <dt>in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</dt> 
            </dl>

        <h3>About the Author</h3>
        <p>
        	William Shakespeare is an amazing font of dick jokes.  He spends his time being dead and being alternately lionized and argued over by a bunch of snotty old white men that he probably would have delighted in throwing moldy bread at.  For more about the author, please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">this slightly more accurate biography.</a>
